# ❤️ Heart Failure EDA

## 📌 Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart failure dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in patient health data.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze clinical features related to heart disease  
- Visualize distributions and correlations  
- Identify key factors linked to heart failure  

## 📊 Dataset
